Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- composer Install
- npm install && npm run dev
- Daftarkan nama db, username, password di .env
- php artisan key:generate
- php artisan migrate
- php artisan db:seed
- php artisan serve
- kunjungi http://127.0.0.1:8000/transaction/
- Public demo : https://test2.sinergisolusiweb.web.id/transaction

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
